# Project Log: Salon Maroc Booking Platform

## 2023-06-04 - Initial Implementation of Booking Page

### Changes:
1. Created a responsive booking page with multi-step form (Booking.tsx)
2. Implemented supporting components:
   - BookingSteps: Visual progress indicator
   - ServiceSelector: Service selection cards
   - StylistSelector: Stylist selection cards
   - TimeSelector: Date and time selection

### Design Decisions:
- Used a step-by-step approach to simplify the booking process
- Implemented card-based selectors for visual appeal and easy selection
- Added validation to ensure each step is completed before proceeding
- Used soft pastel colors and elegant typography as requested in the design brief
- Created responsive layouts that work well on mobile and desktop

### Next Steps:
- Connect the booking form to Supabase for data storage
- Implement authentication for user accounts
- Create admin dashboard for appointment management
- Implement email notifications for booking confirmations

### Technical Notes:
- Used shadcn/ui components for consistent design
- Implemented form validation for required fields
- Added French locale for date formatting to match Moroccan context
- Created mock data for services and stylists (to be replaced with database data)

## 2023-06-05 - Bug Fix: Invalid Icon Import

### Changes:
1. Fixed an error in the Booking.tsx file where we were incorrectly importing a non-existent `ScissorsLinear` icon from lucide-react
2. Replaced it with the standard `Scissors` icon that is available in the library

### Technical Notes:
- Always verify that the icon names being imported from lucide-react are actually available in the library
- The error was: "The requested module does not provide an export named 'ScissorsLinear'"

## 2023-06-06 - Bug Fix: Date-fns Locale Import Issue

### Changes:
1. Fixed an error in the TimeSelector.tsx file where we were using CommonJS-style `require()` to import the French locale from date-fns
2. Replaced with ES module import syntax to properly import the French locale

### Technical Notes:
- In modern browser environments and with bundlers like Vite, we must use ES module imports (`import { fr } from 'date-fns/locale'`) instead of CommonJS-style `require()`
- The error was: "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined"

## 2023-06-07 - Supabase Integration and Database Setup

   - Bookings table for appointments (with service_id, stylist_id, client details, date/time)
2. Added sample data for services and stylists
3. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
   - Public read access for services and stylists
   - Public insert access for bookings
4. Fixed TypeScript errors in the booking service:
   - Updated type handling for Supabase responses
   - Improved error handling and null checks
